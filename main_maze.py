L_width = 10                     # Number of columns of the maze matrix
L_height = 10                    # Number of rows of the maze matrix
rect_height,rect_width = 1, 1    # Height and width of the rectangles that represent each cell of the maze matrix (for representation)

### Maze matrixes creation
M_array = matrix_index_create(L_height, L_width)          # Create matrix with the index number of each cell
M_grid = matrix_vertex_create(M_array, L_height, L_width) # Create array with the vertex of the maze (excluding external ones) (main matrix -> maze matrix)
                                                          # A vertex is defined between the indexes of two cell that are neighbours (excluding the diagonal neighbours)
M_visit = np.full((L_height, L_width), 0)                 # Create visited matrix cells. 0 indicates that the cell has not been visited meanwhile 1 means the opposite
cell_init = random.randint(1, L_width*L_height)           # Select a random inital cell in the maze
#cell_init = 1

### Initialization of the parameters of the main loop
cell_current = cell_init                                  # Index of the current cell
cel_previous = cell_current                               # Index of the previous visited cell
M_grid_maze = M_grid.copy()                               # Create a copy of the vertex array that define the maze
exit = False                                              # Boolean that define to exit the main maze loop
N_neig_vi = sum(sum(M_visit))                             # Calculate the number of visited cells (no strictly necessary for the maze realization)
n = 0                                                     # Counter of the number of visited cells
cell_visited_vector = []                                  # Create the vector that determines the visited cells
cell_visited_vector.insert(n, cell_init)                  # Insert the current cell to the visited cells vector
n_step_back = 0                                           # Counter to move back in the visited cells vector in case that the current cell does not have not-visited cells

### Determine that the current cell has been visited
pos_init = matrix_index(cell_current , L_width, L_height) # Get the matrix indexes of the cell_current index
M_visit[pos_init[0], pos_init[1]] = 1                     # Specify that the current_cell is visited in the M_visit matrix
